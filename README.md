Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

Tech Blog will help you network and provide tips within your techy circle. Mhy motivation was to create a simple yet functional way to create, edit and delete posts. It allows people to easily connect and have conversations ir disscusions in comments. I learned about the challlenges you can face in a deployment like seeding and how to better utilize .delete routes.
